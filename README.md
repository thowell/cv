My research at Stanford University focused on embodied intelligence and the development of numerical optimization tools including: differentiable simulation, planning, and predictive control for robotic systems. 

My experience includes internships at Google Brain and DeepMind where I developed additional skills and interests related to reinforcement learning, black-box optimization, differentiable optimization, and parallel computing. I have experience developing open-source projects in C++ and Julia. For a sample of my work, please see: github.com/deepmind/mujoco_mpc. This is an interactive tool for predictive control that I developed in C++ at DeepMind and continue to develop and maintain. Additionally, I have experience fabricating and performing hardware experiments with quadrotor and quadruped platforms.

I am passionate about using artificial intelligence and optimization to address challenging decision making and control problems by combining cutting-edge research and performant software engineering in order build robots that advance humanity.
